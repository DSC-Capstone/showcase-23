Title: Active Learning with Neural Processes for Epidemiology Modeling

Abstract: Simulations in different fields such as epidemiology use systems that learn complex modeling very accurately, using immense processing power and storage. One way to train a system that is able to efficiently model the task at hand is by designing a model such that it can learn from different data fidelities. Multi-fidelity models train neural processes on multi-fidelity datasets and sample a range of predictions while achieving cheaper simulation costs and better predictions in comparison with other models. To improve on performance, this paper utilizes a technique called active learning. Active learning determines which training data to train on next via a reward function, further improving training convergence and stability. This paper explores the possibilities of extending active learning to multi-fidelity neural processes in order to improve accuracy, training time, and simulation cost.
